You might need extra-long wires to attach your component (for example LED, button, or buzzer) to your Raspberry Pi pins. You can do this by 'daisy chaining' wires together. For instance, to make an extra-long socket-socket wire, you can attach an pin-socket wire to a socket-socket wire.

**Tip:** keep the colour of the wire the same to make it easier to follow fro the component to the Raspberry Pi pin.

The problem with this method is that often the wires will become detached from each other. You can use a small piece of tape to secure the connection.
